AModules3 relies on SMlite template engine, which is designed to be flexible
for developers and acceptable for lazy designers. The main idea behind is
to define on existing HTML page "regions" which are manipulated inside
PHP code. Only basic tags are possible keeping all the logic away from
templates and making templates easier to write. Also replacing templates with
new ones is very easy, since you do not have to copy any code.

By default we use <?...?> tags to inside templates. Those tags should be
respected by major HTML visual editors and left untouched. Here is a sample
html mockup:

<html>
<head>
 <title>Page Sample</title>
</head>
<html>
<table>
<h1>Page Sample</h1>
 <tr><td>
   Hello world
 </td></tr>
</table>
</html>

To make it work we need to define some regions, by adding tags, like this:

<title><?page_title?>Page Sample<?/page_title?></title>

Notice, that original text stays on the page. Template with the tags inserted will
look just the same as it was before insterting tags in browsers and editors. With
other template engines the look of the page would have been transformed and hard to
understand for designer.

To close template tags you may also use <?/?>, which closes most recent opened tag,
but i suggest you to use closing tags in their full form if you opened it on the different
line and it have lots of info in it. Just to make sure you don't forget or mix up any
tags, template engine would validate full-form closing tags

<html>
<head>
 <title><?page_title?>Page Sample<?/?></title>
</head>
<html>
<h1><?page_title?>Page Sample<?/?></h1>
<table>
 <tr><td>
  <?content?>
   Hello world
   <?/content?>
 </td></tr>
</table>
</html>

Notice that same tag may be defined several times. In this case, the same text will be inserted
in multiple places, when you try to change it from PHP.

Now, some tag content may be useless, other tag content might be useful. For example "Page Sample"
text is of no use for us and we would simple replace it, howether check the following example:

<?lister?>
<table>
 <tr><th>ID</th><th>Name</th><th>Surname</th></tr>
 <?rows?>
  <?row?>
   <tr>
    <td><?id?>1<?/?></td>
    <td><?name?>John<?/?></td>
    <td><?surname?>Smith<?/?></td>
   </tr>
  <?/row?>
   <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Bill</td>
    <td>Stivens</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>Dorothy</td>
    <td>Atkinson</td>
   </tr>
  <?/rows?>
</table>
<?/lister?>

In this example, we have the following tag structure
 lister -> rows -> row -> id/name/surname

Here we would want have no need for John, Smith, Bill or Dorothy text. We would also need only one
row to define our template and 2nd and 3rd row is of no need. The overal structure(<table>) is interesting,
so we'll do the following:
1) clone structure of "row"
2) delete content of "rows"

then for each record we:

3) render "row" for to build each row
4) add rendered text into "rows" spot
    
and after that we:

5) render "lister"

In the code this might look like this:

$lister = new SMlite('templates/lister');
$row = $lister->cloneBranch('row');
$lister -> del('rows');

while($row_data = getAssocDataRow()){
    $row->set($row_data);
    $lister->append('rows',$row->render());
}

echo $lister->render();


Well, it might look a bit complicated, howether inside AModules3, this is wraped up into it's framework and you
probably won't have to deal with SMlite directly.

Ok, next important thing is that each object have it's template. Just now you saw how template is defined for
"lister". This is a perfect example to use with standard Lister class.

See object_structure to learn about object structure. Now when you add a new object you may use a part of parent's
template as child template. For instance you may create object Row. When you call add(), you need to specify
2 parameters - 2 tags. First tag is used to get subtree for child (used in cloneBranch), 2nd argument is
used as a spot on the parent's template, where rendered child will be placed. In case of our lister, you
would use "row" as a template for child and "rows" as a spot where to place rendered result.

Note that we should always keep in mind, that creating lots of object might be CPU intensive. Do not create
new branch for every row in the lister, instead re-use the same one. See documentation on Lister class how to
use it effectively.

I might have choosen another sample as to place forms on the page, but that would be too complicated and lots of
text for this help file :)


BTW you may also use tags in form <?$page_title?> or <?page_title/?>. Which is the same as <?page_title?><?/?>
but shorter.




You might see some unusual ways the templates are used. For example when using template with Page, tag called
<?frame_this?> is used for puting frame around the page. See Page:frame_this.txt for more information.
