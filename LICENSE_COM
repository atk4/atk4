(THE "Software"), IN BOTH SOURCE AND OBJECT CODE FORM, AND/OR ALL

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THE TERMS OR CONDITIONS OF THIS

THE SOFTWARE IS PROTECTED BY UNITED KINGDOM COPYRIGHT LAWS AND
INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT LAWS, AS WELL AS OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
LAWS AND TREATIES. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED, NOT SOLD.

THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT DESCRIBES YOUR RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE
SOFTWARE AND ITS COMPONENTS.

1. OWNERSHIP, LICENSE GRANT

This is a license agreement and not an agreement for sale. We reserve
ownership of all intellectual property rights inherent in or relating
to the Software, which include, but are not limited to, all copyright,
patent rights, all rights in relation to registered and unregistered
trademarks (including service marks), confidential information
(including trade secrets and know-how) and all rights other than those
expressly granted by this Agreement.

Subject to the payment of the fee required and subject to the terms
and conditions of this License Agreement, We grant to You a revocable,
non-transferable and non-exclusive license (i) for a Designated User(s)
(as defined below) within Your organization to install and use the
Software on any workstations used exclusively by such Designated User
and (ii) for You to install and use the Software in connection with
unlimited domains and sub-domains on unlimited servers, solely in
connection with distribution of the Software in accordance with
sections 3 and 4 below. This license is not sub-licensable except
as explicitly set forth herein. "Designated User(s)" shall mean Your
employee(s) acting within the scope of their employment or Your
consultant(s) or contractor(s) acting within the scope of the services
they provide for You or on Your behalf for whom You have purchased
a license to use the Software.

2. PERMITTED USES, SOURCE CODE, MODIFICATIONS

We provide You with source code so that You can create Modifications
of the original Software, where Modification means: a) any addition
to or deletion from the contents of a file included in the original
Software or previous Modifications created by You, or b) any new file
that contains any part of the original Software or previous
Modifications. While You retain all rights to any original work
authored by You as part of the Modifications, We continue to own all
copyright and other intellectual property rights in the Software.

3. DISTRIBUTION

You may distribute the Software in any applications, frameworks, or
elements that you develop using the Software in accordance with this
License Agreement, provided that such distribution does not violate
the restrictions set forth in section 4 of this agreement. You must
not remove, obscure or interfere with any copyright, acknowledgment,
attribution, trademark, warning or disclaimer statement affixed to,
incorporated in or otherwise applied in connection with the Software.

You are required to ensure that the Software is not reused by or with
any applications other than those with which You distribute it as
permitted herein. For example, if You install the Software on a
customer's server, that customer is not permitted to use the Software
independently of Your application, and must be informed as such.

You will not owe Us any royalties for Your distribution of the
Software in accordance with this License Agreement.

4. PROHIBITED USES

You may not, without Our prior written consent, redistribute the
Software or Modifications other than by including the Software or a
portion thereof within Your own product, which must have substantially
different functionality than the Software or Modifications and must not
allow any third party to use the Software or Modifications, or any
portions thereof, for software development purposes. You are explicitly
not allowed to redistribute the Software or Modifications as part of
any product that can be described as a development toolkit or library
or is intended for use by software developers and not end-users. You
are not allowed to redistribute any part of the Software documentation.

You may not: a) use any part of the Software or Modifications or Your
knowledge of the Software (or any information that You learn as a
result of Your use of the Software) to create a product with the same
or substantially the same functionality as the Software; b) transfer,
rent, lease, or sublicense the Software or Modifications, or any
portions thereof; c) change or remove the copyright notice from any
of the files included in the Software or Modifications.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES MAY YOU USE THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION THE SOURCE CODE THEREOF) AS THE BASIS FOR OR IN CONNECTION
WITH A PRODUCT THAT CONTAINS THE SAME, OR SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME,
FUNCTIONALITY AS THE SOFTWARE.

5. TERMINATION

This License Agreement and Your right to use the Software and
Modifications will terminate immediately without notice if You fail
to comply with the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.
Upon termination, You agree to immediately cease using and destroy
the Software or Modifications, including all accompanying documents.
The provisions of sections 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
termination of this License Agreement.

THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR
ERROR-FREE, AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS NOT TECHNICALLY
PRACTICABLE FOR US TO DO SO.

WE OR OUR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS
OF BUSINESS INFORMATION OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LAW) ARISING OUT OF
THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN ANY CASE, OUR ENTIRE
LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT SHALL BE
LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE

may choose to offer acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
Agreement. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act
only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on our

consent. This License Agreement will inure to the benefit of Our
successors and assigns.

You acknowledge that this License Agreement is complete and is the

License Agreement in any way, and You may not rely on any such oral
or written information.

If any provision in this License Agreement shall be determined to be
invalid, such provision shall be deemed omitted; the remainder of
this License Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

This License Agreement may be modified only by a written instrument
signed by an authorized representative of each party.
